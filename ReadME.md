###  Featured Projects

####  **Futsal Booking System** *(BSc CSIT Final Year Project)*
A platform designed to streamline the futsal booking process for users, futsal owners, and administrators. The system ensures fairness, reliability, and user engagement through advanced features like **reward systems**, **strong locking algorithms**, and **priority-based slot allocation**. This project was developed as part of my **BSc CSIT Final Year Project**.

- **Technologies Used**: React, Nest.js, Postgres, Tailwind CSS, HTML5, CSS3.
- **Key Features**:

  **1. Role-Based Access Control:**
  - **Futsal Owners**:
    - Register and add their futsal courts to the platform.
    - Submit court details for admin approval.
    - View and manage bookings for their courts.
    - Update court availability, pricing, and details.
  - **Admin**:
    - Approve or reject futsal court registrations.
    - Delete existing futsals if they violate platform policies.
    - Monitor and manage all courts, bookings, and user accounts.
  - **Users**:
    - Search and book futsals based on location, availability.
    - View booking history and manage upcoming bookings.

  **2. Reward System:**
  - Users earn **2 points** for every successful booking.
  - If a user manually cancels a booking, **4 points** are deducted from their profile.
  - Encourages responsible booking behavior and increases user engagement.

  **3. Priority-Based Slot Allocation:**
  - If two users attempt to book the same slot simultaneously:
    - The user with **higher points** is given priority and awarded the slot.
    - The other user's booking is **automatically canceled without deducting points** (system cancellation).
  - If both users have the **same points**:
    - The system randomly selects one user to award the slot.
    - The other user's booking is **automatically canceled without deducting points** (system cancellation).
  - Ensures fairness and rewards loyal users.

  **4. Advanced Booking Algorithm:**
  - Implemented **Pessimistic Locking** to prevent overlapping bookings.
  - Ensures that only one user can reserve a time slot at a time, making the system fair and reliable for all.

  **5. User-Friendly Features:**
  - Search and filtering of futsals based on location, availability.
  - Secure payment integration for booking transactions.
  - Responsive design optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

  **6. Admin Dashboard:**
  - Centralized control panel for managing futsals, bookings, and user accounts.
  - Tools to monitor system activity and resolve issues efficiently.

- **Live Demo**: [Futsal Booking System](https://your-futsal-booking-system-link.com) *(Launching Soon)*

### Why This Project Stands Out:
- **Academic Excellence**: Developed as part of my **BSc CSIT Final Year Project**, showcasing my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world problems.
- **Fairness and Reliability**: The use of **Pessimistic Locking** and **priority-based slot allocation** ensures that bookings are handled in a fair and conflict-free manner.
- **User Engagement**: The **reward system** incentivizes users to book responsibly while discouraging cancellations.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle a growing number of users, futsals, and bookings without compromising performance.
- **Policy Enforcement**: Admins have the power to enforce platform policies by approving, rejecting, or deleting futsals as needed.
